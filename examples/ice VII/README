dip_data shows some data of each configuration.

1st column: xx of input_confxx
2nd column: Multiplicity of each configuration. Summing all numbers amounts 8100.
3rd column: Directions of dipole moments of two sublattices.
4th column: Direction of total dipole moment
5th column: Type of two sublattices (Ic1~4 in our CPL 2010).
