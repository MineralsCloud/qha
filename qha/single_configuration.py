    A harmonic oscillator energy sampler. The differences between ``free_energy`` and ``HOFreeEnergySampler`` are

    - ``HOFreeEnergySampler`` provides you with several ways to compute free energies on different q-point, band or
        volume, which could be used to check the correctness of the data.
    - ``HOFreeEnergySampler`` can make calculation lazy, so we can apply it onto a grid, rather than directly
            calculates the values immediately.
    - ``free_energy`` is usually enough for computing the final free energy results. ``HOFreeEnergySampler``
      only calculates its vibrational part, static energies is not counted.
