Plot results command: ``qha-plot``
**********************************

We have also provided a command which can plot
the results after running ``qha-run`` for quick
check.

Just redirect to the folder where you run
``qha-run`` and run ``qha-plot``, the plots will
be in the same directory as previous results.
