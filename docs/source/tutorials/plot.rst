Plot results command: ``qha plot``
**********************************

We have also provided a command which can plot
the results after running ``qha run /path/to/settings.yaml`` for a quick check.

User has to redirect to the folder where he/she run
``qha run /path/to/settings.yaml`` and run ``qha plot /path/to/settings.yaml``, the plots will
be in the same directory as previous results.
